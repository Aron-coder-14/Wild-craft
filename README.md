# Wild Craft

Wild Craft is a beginner-level game project developed using the [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) framework. The goal of the project is to provide an immersive simulation experience where a character can move and explore a landscape using basic movement mechanics and a camera system. 

The project is designed for beginners who are interested in game development using LÖVE2D, with an emphasis on learning how to implement fundamental game systems such as character movement, background scaling, and camera control. While currently focused on these core mechanics, the future of Wild Craft is ambitious but still undefined.

## Features
- **Character Movement**: The player can move the character using the arrow keys.
- **Dynamic Camera**: A camera follows the player's movement and centers the view on the player.
- **Background Scaling**: The background dynamically scales to the screen size, providing a consistent view regardless of the resolution.
- **Character Flip**: The character sprite flips when moving left to give a sense of directional movement.

## Future Ambitions
- While this project is currently in its early stages, future plans include more complex gameplay mechanics, improved graphics, and additional environments. The specific direction of these future developments remains undecided.

## Installation and Running the Game
1. **Install LÖVE2D**:  
   You need to have LÖVE2D installed to run the game. Download it from [here](https://love2d.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aron-coder-14/Wild-craft
   cd Wild-craft
   ```

3. **Run the Game**:
   ```bash
   love .
   ```

## Project Structure
- **simulator.lua**: Contains the core game logic, including character movement, camera control, and background scaling.
- **libraries/hump/camera.lua**: The [HUMP](https://github.com/vrld/hump) library for smooth camera movement.
- **utils/graphics/scaler.lua**: A utility script to handle background scaling based on the screen size.
