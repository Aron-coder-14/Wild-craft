# LX Library Intern Repository

Welcome to the LX Library Intern Repository!

This repository is issued to interested unpaid interns of LX Library. Here, you will find resources and materials to assist you in your internship experience with us.

## Contents

- **main.lua**: This file contains a variety of potential game types that you can work on during your internship. Your contributions to these games will determine your progress and future opportunities at LX Library.
- **installlibs.bat**: This script installs a number of libraries that have been used in our experience with Love2D. These libraries may be useful for developing the games outlined in `main.lua`.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `installlibs.bat` to install the necessary libraries.
3. Explore `main.lua` to see the potential game types you can work on.
4. To propose a different type of game or discuss any ideas, please speak to your intern supervisor.

## Contact

If you have any questionsm asset requests, or need assistance, feel free to contact your intern supervisor via the mode of communication already initiated or: keagangilmore@gmail.com.
